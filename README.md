# KanbanVue

KanbanVue is a web app built using the Vuejs framework, specifically HTML, CSS and Javascript. It allows users to manage their tasks in a Jira-like environment. Tasks can be tracked in the landing page as simple todos or in a kanban board, organized depending on their status. The app can also notify the user of due tasks via custom notifications.
